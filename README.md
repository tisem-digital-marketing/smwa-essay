## Instructions for Students

Upload your essay as a PDF to this repository before the due date.

After your submission, the instructors will upload a grading rubric with information about the group component of your grade.

Information on writing an report instead of a group presentation is as follows:

* Your report is due at the date and time before your Lab Section would begin, i.e. at 10:30AM, OR due to a personalized deadline. 
    * When the submission link is sent to you, we will confirm your due date.
* The report topic will be the same as that your presentation group will be assigned to, and demands the same content.
* Write it as if you were submitting a written document that would be the main point of discussion in a meeting of executives, data scientists and marketing analysts about the assigned topic
* You will have a word limit (maximum) of 1250 words. Your grade is 100% determined by the report's written content, there is no weight assigned to an individual reflection or questions asked during other group presentations.
* Make sure your writing is well structured, answers the question at hand and is not unnecessarily convoluted.      
    * The submission can and should be written in a way that uses headings and subheadings to add clarity for the reader, rather than an un-sectioned essay
